## How to Collaborate

Collaborating on GitHub involves working with others to create, review, and merge changes to a repository. Here are the steps to get started:

Fork the repository: Forking creates a personal copy of the repository you want to contribute to. Click on the "Fork" button on the repository's page to create a fork.

Clone the repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using git clone <forked repository URL> command in your terminal.

Create a new branch: Create a new branch to work on using git checkout -b <new-branch-name> command.

Make changes: Make changes to the files in your local repository.

Commit changes: Once you're done making changes, stage the changes using git add <file-name> command and commit them using git commit -m "<commit-message>" command.

Push changes: Push the changes to your forked repository using git push origin <new-branch-name> command.

Create a pull request: Go to the original repository and create a pull request by clicking on the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and the branch you created in step 3.

Review and merge changes: The repository owner or maintainer will review your changes and either merge them or provide feedback for further changes.

Keep your fork updated: If the original repository is updated, make sure to keep your fork updated using git fetch upstream and git merge upstream/main commands.

These are the basic steps to collaborate on GitHub. Keep in mind that different projects may have their own guidelines and conventions for collaboration, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before contributing.
